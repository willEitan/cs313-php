After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Provide a link to your myDb.sql file at GitHub (the file that contains all the SQL commands needed to create your database).

https://github.com/willEitan/cs313-php/tree/master/web/dbs

2. Describe something from your database that you think came together very nicely.

I think that my user_info table came together very nicely as a way to avoid duplicating information

3. Describe something from your database that you think could be improved or extended in the future.

Time will tell, but I think I've covered all my bases. Some more work might need to be put into the handling of transactions.

4. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

the Serial data type is pretty cool. It creates and maintains its own sequences

5. Briefly describe two principles of good database design.

No duplicate data. Create tables that have only things related--smallest logical parts.

6. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

5

7. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

I reached all of the requirements and went beyond by creating more tables and columns for all potential needs in my website.
